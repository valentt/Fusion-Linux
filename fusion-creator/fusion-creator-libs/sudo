  SETUP SUDO FOR YOUR USER ACCOUNT
  ----------------------------

  Some people like to use sudo instead of the root account for doing
  administrative tasks, especially if you already got used to using
  sudo on other Linux distros. 

  If you choose to enable sudo you can run commands in terminal with root 
  privileges using only your personal account password. 

  Would like to enable sudo? If you are uncertain skip this step.


      Enable sudo for user \"$USER\" ?


  You will be promted for your administrator password, so please
  have it ready.

  Hit any key to add SUDO support for $USER user, or \"s\" to skip..."

read -n1 a
a=`echo $a | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
if [ "$a" != "s" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "$USER ALL=(ALL)      NOPASSWD: ALL" > SUDO
    su -c 'cat SUDO >> /etc/sudoers'
    rm SUDO
fi
