  EASY ON THE EYES WITH REDSHIFT
  ----------------------------

  Redshift adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to the 
  position of the sun. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are
  working in front of the screen at night.

  A different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During 
  twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
  from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly adapt.

  Would like to run Redshift and automatically start each time you log on?


      add gtk-redshift.desktop to your ~/.config/autostart folder?


  Hit any key to add Redshift to your autostart folder, or \"s\" to skip..."

read -n1 a
a=`echo $a | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
if [ "$a" != "s" ]; then
  if [ ! -d  ~/.config/autostart ]; then
       mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
  fi
    cp /usr/share/applications/gtk-redshift.desktop ~/.config/autostart/gtk-redshift.desktop
    gtk-redshift &> /dev/null &
fi
