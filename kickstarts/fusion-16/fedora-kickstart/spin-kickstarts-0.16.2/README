The master branch is where development takes place:
 - it may contain kickstart files that are broken, or
 - spin concepts that are in the process of being
   approved by the Board (trademark approval), or
 - spin concepts that are in the process of being
   approved by the Spins SIG

The release specific branches contain spin concepts that:
 - are approved (both by Board and Spin SIG)
 - maintained for the remainder of the release cycle

When kickstart files are added or removed, Makefile.am should be updated to
reflect the change.

To rebuild the srpm for a new version or a new release without patches:

git clone ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spin-kickstarts.git spin-kickstarts
cd spin-kickstarts
# If you need a specific branch other than master:
git checkout BRANCHNAME
# Edit configure.ac to update the version or release
# Edit spin-kickstarts.spec.in to update the change log
git commit -a
git push
aclocal
automake
autoconf
./configure
make dist
install -D -m 644 spin-kickstarts-*.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
# Edit spin-kickstarts.spec if some changelog history needs to be included
install -D -m 644 spin-kickstarts.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/spin-kickstarts.spec
# If the sprm gets published then publish the tar.gz file on fedorahosted
scp spin-kickstarts-*.tar.gz fedorahosted.org:spin-kickstarts
# Clean up the generated files:
git clean -f -d
# To update a branch of spin-kickstarts
#   Make sure the branch is current (git pull)
#   Copy over the new spec file
#   In each branch run make new-sources FILES=/pathto/spin-kickstarts-*.tar.gz
#   Commit the changes with git commit -a
#   Make a new tag with make tag
#   Do the build with make build
