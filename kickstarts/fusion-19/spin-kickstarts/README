The master branch is where development takes place:
 - it may contain kickstart files that are broken, or
 - spin concepts that are in the process of being
   approved by the Board (trademark approval), or
 - spin concepts that are in the process of being
   approved by the Spins SIG

The release specific branches contain spin concepts that:
 - are approved (both by Board and Spin SIG)
 - maintained for the remainder of the release cycle
