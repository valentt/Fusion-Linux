== NOTICE ==

These kickstarts are localized versions of the custom or official Fedora
Spins.

Kickstarts in this directory need to %include ../*.ks, or ../custom/*.ks

Note: when composing localized kickstarts on Fedora 17 and later, you must
use yum-langpacks to ensure you get the proper packages. To do so:

1) Use livecd-tools-17.9/18.4 or later
2) Have yum-langpacks installed, and configured for the language you're
composing (either in /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/langpacks.conf or via
$LANG/$LANGUAGE)
3) Use the '-p' option to livecd-creator to enable plugins.
