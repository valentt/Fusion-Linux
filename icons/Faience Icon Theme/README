Installation
============
Run the ./INSTALL script to copy the iconsets to your home folder. 
If run as root, the script will copy the iconsets to /usr/share/icons to made them available to all users.

This theme is a work in progress and still depends on Faenza icon theme. You can download it on my DeviantArt page (http://tiheum.deviantart.com) or install it from my PPA repository (ppa:tiheum/equinox).

Tips
====
* Ubuntu 10.10: the Unity panel has a strange behavior with some icons compared with the previous version (and Gnome 2 panels of course), especially with user menu and battery state icons. If you want to use Unity, you might select the new Faience-Claire theme instead of the other ones dedicated to Gnome-Shell. Faience-Claire suits well with Radiance.
* Some applications are configured to always use the same icon regardless of the selected theme. To display the Faience/Faenza icon, edit as root the /usr/share/applications/application_name.desktop file and locate the line beginning with 'Icon='. Replace the fullpath icon name by the one of the Faience/Faenza icon (usually, the name of the application itself) without the extension. Don't forget to make a backup before changing one of those files. 
    E.g. Vim desktop file is /usr/share/applications/gvim.desktop
    Some desktop files can be located in /usr/local/share/applications or in your ~/.local/share/applications folder (e.g. Steam desktop file is somewhere in ~/.local/share/applications/wine).
    Here is a partial list: emacs23, desura, gcolor2, bluefish, hardinfo, setroubleshoot, gufw, pithos, vim, rssowl, netbeans, gazpacho, guake, all commercial games, etc
* If you want to use the new Gnome Contacts application, edit its desktop file (/usr/share/applications/gnome-contacts.desktop) to use the specific (and beautiful) icon named gnome-contacts ;)
