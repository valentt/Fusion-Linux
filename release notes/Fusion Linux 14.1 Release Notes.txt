Fusion Linux 14 "Thorium" release notes
=======================================

/About Fusion Linux/
====================

Fusion Linux is a Fedora Remix that uses a combination of free and open-source, non-free and non-open-source firmware and software, to bring the user the most advanced experience on the Linux platform.

Fusion Linux includes an outstanding theme, multimedia functionality out of the box and added desktop tweaks for better usability. 

Guiding principles behind Fusion Linux are “Beyond Upstream” and “Multimedia Out of the Box”. 

And finally, Fusion Linux is 100% compatible with Fedora. :)
