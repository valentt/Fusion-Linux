Fusion Linux 14 "Shagadelic Fusion" release notes

Fusion Linux is a Fedora Remix that includes all the best software that is available for Linux. Fusion uses a combination of free and open-source, non-free and non-open-source firmware and software, to bring the user the most advanced experience on the Linux platform.

Fusion Linux is an installable Live image that includes multimedia functionality out of the box, with added desktop tweaks for better usability and additional software. It also gives the user the option of installing the operating system to the hard disk for a much better user experience.

Fusion Linux is 100% compatible with Fedora. A Fedora Remix including packages from Fedora and RPM Fusion software repositories plus some custom packages.

FUSION LINUX GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Guiding principles behind this Fedora Remix are; “Beyond Upstream” and “Multimedia Out of the Box”. You can also think of it as a “Pimp My Ride” version of Fedora!

Fedora is closely tied with upstream which can stifle progress and experimentation regarding the look and feel of the desktop experience. Hence the need for the desktop Fedora Remix.
Because of this opportunity we decided to make an awesome looking Fedora Remix oriented for advanced desktop users and Linux enthusiasts.

To clarify what “Beyond Upstream” means, you have to understand that the Fedora Project is really closely tied with the upstream projects and the Fedora Developers don’t do anything that upstream don’t approve. One of the drawbacks is that “Upstream Only” makes for a too conservative and old fashioned desktop user experience. This is where Fusion Linux steps in.

* mintMenu and DockbarX 
mintMenu and DockbarX are two GNOME panel addons that make this Linux distro unique and these are the most obvious features that you will encounter first time you login.

- If you would like to test only mintMenu and disable DockbarX type this into terminal window:
gconftool-2 --load /usr/share/fusion-linux/gconf2/one-panel-settings.xml

- For standard GNOME look & feel just type this into terminal:
gconftool-2 --load /usr/share/fusion-linux/gconf2/default-panel-settings.xml

- And again for full mintMenu + DockbarX desktop this is the magic key:
gconftool-2 --load /usr/share/fusion-linux/gconf2/one-panel-settings-dockbarx.xml
