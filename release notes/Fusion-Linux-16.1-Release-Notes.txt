Fusion Linux 16.1 "XXX" release notes
=======================================

/About Fusion Linux/
====================

Fusion Linux is a Fedora Remix that uses a combination of free and open-source, non-free and non-open-source firmware and software, to bring the user the most advanced experience on the Linux platform.

Fusion Linux includes an outstanding theme, multimedia functionality out of the box and added desktop tweaks for better usability. 

Guiding principles behind Fusion Linux are "Beyond Upstream" and "Multimedia Out of the Box". 

And finally, Fusion Linux is 100% compatible with Fedora. :)


/About this release/
====================

This release has been in the making for few months, and it is mostly an update to out initial release. Biggest new feature is LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice and two biggest bugs squashed. One bug prevented Firefox 4.0 from starting while using it as LiveUSB or LiveDVD and other bug was a dependency issue that prevented updates from being downloaded. We hoped with this release to make all desktop components more stable and put an overall desktop polish.

Highlighted software packages:
* Linux kernel 3.2.5
* LibreOffice 3.4.5
* Firefox 10
* Thunderbird 10
* GIMP 2.7.4 with Single Windowd Mode by default
* Openshot 1.4
* VLC player 1.1
* Blender 2.59
* Inkscape 0.48

* Cinnamon desktop instead GNOME 3

* Fusion Linux post install welcome wizard script
* multimedia support out of the box (Flash, MP3 & DivX playback)

We put a lot of work in the brand new custom made theme. It is based on Faenza icons and Alliance GTK theme with the little Fusion touch.
