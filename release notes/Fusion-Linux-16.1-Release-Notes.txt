Fusion Linux 16.1 "XXX" release notes
=======================================

/About Fusion Linux/
====================

Fusion Linux is a Fedora Remix that uses a combination of free and open-source, non-free and non-open-source firmware and software, to bring the user the most advanced experience on the Linux platform.

Fusion Linux includes an outstanding theme, multimedia functionality out of the box and added desktop tweaks for better usability. 

Guiding principles behind Fusion Linux are "Beyond Upstream" and "Multimedia Out of the Box". 

And finally, Fusion Linux is 100% compatible with Fedora. :)


/About this release/
====================

This release was long overdue, but big switch from GNOME2 to GNOME3 made releasing Fusion Linux much harder because GNOME3 has disrupted lots of enhancements that Fusion Linux relied upon.
In this release, first real release since Fusion 14.1 you are seeing Fusion Linux almost in its full glory previous to GNOME3 release. We are using GNOME3 but we use Cinnamon instead of GNOME-Shell.


Features and highlights are:
* Cinnamon desktop instead GNOME 3
* Jockey restricted/proprietary driver manager 
* Fedora Utils post install tweak tool
* New download managers - Tucan and Uget
* New remote desktop app - Remmina
* a brand new custom made theme
* Fusion Linux post install welcome wizard script
* multimedia support out of the box (Flash, MP3 & DivX playback)
* better hardware compatibility for broadcom wireless cards
* better games selection

We put a lot of work in the brand new custom made theme. It is based on Faenza icons and Alliance GTK theme with the little Fusion touch.

Desktop highlihgts:
* Cinnamon desktop
* Synapse


Software highlights:
* Linux kernel 3.2.7
* LibreOffice 3.4.5
* Firefox 10
* Thunderbird 10
* GIMP 2.7.4 with Single Windowd Mode by default
* Openshot 1.4
* VLC player 1.1
* Blender 2.59
* Inkscape 0.48
* Flash plugin 11.1
* Synapse 0.2.6 (Gnome-Do alternative quick-start app)
* K3b - best CD/DVD and Blu-ray burning app
* Dropbox - online backup and file sync
* TeamViewer - multiplatform remote desktop app

* Arista video transcoder - right click on any video file to convert
* PlayOnLinux - easily install numerous Windows games and apps
* GParted - partition editor for graphically managing your disk partitions
* FedoraTools - scripts for customizing your Fusion/Fedora OS
* Redshift - takes care of your eyes if you work late

Chromium is the default browser. We think Firefox 4.0 is great and is included, but but we still prefer Chromium.

Desktop tweaks:
