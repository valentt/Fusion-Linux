Community Fedora Remix 13.1 "Lucky 13"

Community Fedora Remix 13.1 "Lucky 13" live DVD/USB announcement

There are two basic guiding principle behind this Fedora Remix, first one is "beyond upstream" and "multimedia out of the box", you can also think of it like Pimp My Ride version of Fedora ;)

To clarify a bit what "beyond upstream" means you have to know that Fedora is really close tied with upstream projects and Fedora developers won't do anything that upstream doesn't do, and "upstream only" mentality has lots good things going for it.

One of the deawbacks is that "upsteram only" makes for too conservative and old fashioned Desktop when look and feel of Desktop is concerned. Design of Fedora is great, I'm not talking about great artwork that Fedora Design team has made. 

Fedora is just too closely tied to upstream and this is doesn't allow much progress and experimentation on the look and feel side of things, that is why there are Remixes, because of this opportunity we decided to make an awesome looking Fedora Remix oriented for Desktop users.

This Fedora Remix is also very much influenced by Linux Mint and with its community.

* mintMenu and DockbarX 
mintMenu and DockbarX are two GNOME panel addons that make this Linux distro unique and these are the most obvious features that you will encounter first time you login.

- If you would like to test only mintMenu and disable DockbarX type this into terminal window:
gconftool-2 --load /usr/share/community-fedora-remix/gconf2/one-panel-settings.xml

- For standard GNOME look & feel just type this into terminal:
gconftool-2 --load /usr/share/community-fedora-remix/gconf2/default-panel-settings.xml

- And again for full mintMenu + DockbarX desktop this is the magic key:
gconftool-2 --load /usr/share/community-fedora-remix/gconf2/one-panel-settings-dockbarx.xml
