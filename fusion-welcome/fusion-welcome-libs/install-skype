  By default, Fusion Linux does not come with Skype support.  We have 
  contacted Skype and asked for permission to have Skype client isntalled
  by default but Skype denied our request.

  Would you like to install Skype now?

      yum install skype

  You will be promted for your administrator password, so please
  have it ready.

  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies may also be installed.
