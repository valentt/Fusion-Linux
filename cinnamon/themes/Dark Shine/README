To install this theme: Download it and decompress it in ~/.themes
(or /usr/share/themes to install it system-wide) make sure you take ownership of folder Dark Shine.

Dark Shine is a new modern theme for Cinnamon. It tries to blend transparency and usability, with smooth transition effects between different elements. Dark Shine is a bit squarish and perhaps the best match for Faenza icons.
